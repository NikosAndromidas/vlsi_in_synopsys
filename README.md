# VLSI 2 â€“ Verilog Projects

This repository contains solutions to several basic hardware design problems developed as part of the **VLSI 2 (Î£Ï‡ÎµÎ´Î¹Î±ÏƒÎ¼ÏŒÏ‚ Î£Ï…ÏƒÏ„Î·Î¼Î¬Ï„Ï‰Î½ ÏƒÎµ VLSI)** undergraduate course. All projects were implemented using **Verilog HDL** and synthesized using **Synopsys tools** provided by the Department.

## Project Structure

- `src/` â€“ Verilog source files for various components
- `scripts/` â€“ Synthesis and simulation scripts (`.tcl` for Synopsys tools)
- `results_argmax/` â€“ Synthesis and simulation results for the Argmax module
- `results_fp32_mul/` â€“ Floating point 32-bit multiplier results
- `results_fp32_mulsc/` â€“ (Deleted) Additional floating-point multiplication results
- `results_rca/` â€“ Ripple Carry Adder results
- `results_shiftregister/` â€“ Shift register implementation results
- `results_vmcoffe/` â€“ VMCOFFE results

## Topics Covered

- Floating-point arithmetic (IEEE 754)
- Basic digital components (adder, shift register)
- Argmax operation in digital logic
- Verilog testbenches
- RTL design and synthesis
- Use of Synopsys synthesis tools

## Tools Used

- **Verilog HDL**
- **Synopsys Design Compiler**
- **Unix/Linux environment**
